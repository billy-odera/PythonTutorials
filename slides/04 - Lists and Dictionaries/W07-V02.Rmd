## Overview
- Creating, accessing and modifying lists
- Dictionaries

  - Some of the examples in this unit are taken from: [Python Crash Course - A Hands-on, Project-based, introduction to programming](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Python-Crash-Course-Hands-Project-Based/dp/1593276036)
  - This unit was created with the immense help of [Mr. Jomar Alcantara](https://github.com/joealcantara/) from Aston University, UK.
  
## Python Lists
- Python has a built-in list type, aptly named "list". 
- List literals are written within square brackets, `[ ]`.
- Lists work similarly to strings (and to R vectors) - we can use square brackets `[ ]` to access data
- Unlike R (and like C and several other languages) indexing in Python starts at zero.
```{python}
colors = ['red', 'blue', 'green']
```

## Python Lists
```{python}
colors = ['red', 'blue', 'green']
for i in range(0, 3): # range(0,3) = [0, 1, 2]
  print(colors[i])
  
print len(colors) # length of the "colors" list


```

## Python Lists
- Assignment with `=` on a list object **does not make a copy**. Instead, it generates two variables pointing to the one list in memory. 
```{python}
colors = ['red', 'blue', 'green']
other = colors
other[0] = "yellow"
print(colors)
```

## Python Lists
- You can generate an actual copy in a variety of ways, e.g.:
```{python}
colors = ['red', 'blue', 'green']
other = colors[:] # This is called the "slicing" method
other[0] = "yellow"
print(colors)
print(other)
```

## Working with lists
- Defining lists is simple. Square brackets indicate the start and end of the list and commas separate the items.
```{python}
bicycles = ['trek', 'cannondale', 'redline', 'specialized']
print(bicycles)
```
- You can put any data types in a list (and even mix a bit!)
```{python}
numbers = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
print(numbers)

mix_list = [True, "hi", 34, 3.141592]
print(mix_list)
```

## Working with lists
- You can access elements in a list by their indices. Note the index starts at `0`, not `1`.
```{python}
bicycles = ['trek', 'cannondale', 'redline', 'specialized']
print(bicycles[0])
```

- If you use negative indices you start accessing the list in reverse order, starting from the last element (which is `mylist[-1]`) 
```{python, dependson="bikes"}
print(bicycles[-1])
```

## Working with lists
```{python}
bicycles = ['trek', 'cannondale', 'redline', 'specialized']
print(bicycles)
```
```{python}
bicycles[0] = 'marin' # Replace the first element 

message = "My first bicycle was a " + bicycles[0].title() + '.'
print(message)
```

## Working with lists
- We can grow a list using the `append()` method, which allows us to build lists dynamically.
- The `insert()` method allows us to insert new elements anywhere (not only at the end)
```{python}
bicycles = [] # This makes an empty list
print(bicycles)
bicycles.append('trek')
bicycles.append('cannondale')
print(bicycles)
bicycles += ['redline', 'specialized'] # Another way to append
print(bicycles)
bicycles.insert(1, 'marin') # Inserts this bike at index 1
print(bicycles)
```

## Working with lists
- You can also remove items from a list using the `del` statement
```{python}
bicycles = ['trek', 'cannondale', 'redline', 'specialized']
print(bicycles)
del bicycles[2]
print(bicycles)
```

## Working with lists
- Sometimes you'll want to use the value after you've deleted it from the list.
```{python}
bicycles = ['trek', 'cannondale', 'redline', 'specialized']
popped_bike = bicycles.pop()
print(bicycles)
print(popped_bike)
```
```{python}
# You can pop from any index in the list.
popped_bike = bicycles.pop(1)
print(bicycles)
print(popped_bike)
```

## Working with lists
- You can also remove an item by value
```{python}
bicycles = ['trek', 'cannondale', 'redline', 'specialized']
print(bicycles)
```
```{python}
bicycles.remove("cannondale")
print(bicycles)
```

## Working with lists
- We can sort lists with the `sort()` and `reverse()` methods. Note both these methods permanently sort the list, and there is no way to go back to the original order.

```{python}
bicycles = ['trek', 'cannondale', 'redline', 'specialized']
bicycles.sort()
print(bicycles)
```
```{python}
bicycles.reverse()
print(bicycles)
```

## Working with lists
- If we want to sort a list temporarily, we can use the `sorted()` function.
```{python}
bicycles = ['trek', 'cannondale', 'redline', 'specialized']
print('Unsorted List')
print(bicycles)
```
```{python}
print('Sorted List')
print(sorted(bicycles))
```
```{python}
print('Unsorted List')
print(bicycles)
```

## Working with lists
- If we put this together we some of the loop statements we saw earlier, we can interate through lists. Here is a simple example.
```{python}
bicycles = ['trek', 'cannondale', 'redline', 'specialized']
for bike in bicycles:
    if(len(bike) <= 7):
      print("This bike has a shorter name:\t" + bike)
    else:
      print("This bike has a longer name:\t\t" + bike)
```

## Dictionaries
- Dictionaries are another way in which we can store data.
- The key difference between dictionaries and lists is that dictionaries are _unordered_ sets of `key:value` pairs - instead of accessing data by an index, we do it using field names. 
  - For example, `firstName` would be a key and `"Felipe"` would be the value.
- In Python dictionaries: 
  - each key is separated from its value by a `:`, 
  - the `key:value` pairs are separated by commas
  - the whole thing is enclosed in curly braces. 

## Dictionaries
- An empty dictionary without any items is written with just two curly braces, `{}`.
- Keys are unique within a dictionary, while values need not be.
- The values of a dictionary can be of any type, but the keys must be of an **immutable** data type such as strings, numbers, or tuples.
  - (mutable objects have fields that can be changed, immutable objects have no fields that can be changed after the object is created.)

## Dictionaries
- A few examples of dictionaries (adapted from [here](https://www.python-course.eu/dictionaries.php)) are:
```{python}
empty = {} # an empty dictionary
empty
```
```{python}
# from Monty Python's famous "Spam" number
food = {"ham" : "yes", "egg" : "yes", "spam" : "no" }
food
```
```{python}
food["spam"] # Use key to access/modify value
food["spam"] = "yes"
food
```

## Working with dictionaries
```{python}
alien_0 = {'color': 'green', 'points': 5}
alien_0
```
```{python}
alien_0['x_position'] = 0   # add a new key:value pair
alien_0['y_position'] = 25  # add a new key:value pair
alien_0
```

## Working with dictionaries
```{python}
# Lets put this all together. Here we are moving the alien a certain
# amount on the x axis based on the  'speed' rating we have given it.
alien_0 = {'x_position': 0, 'y_position': 25, 'speed': 'medium'}
print("Original x-position: " + str(alien_0['x_position']))
```
```{python}
# Move the alien based on its current speed.
if alien_0['speed'] == 'slow':
    x_increment = 1
elif alien_0['speed'] == 'medium':
    x_increment = 2
else: # a very fast alien.
    x_increment = 3
# new position = old position + increment.
alien_0['x_position'] += x_increment
print("New x-position: " + str(alien_0['x_position']))
```

## Working with dictionaries
- `key:value` pairs can be deleted in the same way we delete list entries.
```{python}
alien_0 = {'color': 'green', 'points': 5}
print(alien_0)
```
```{python}
del alien_0['points']
print(alien_0)
```

## Working with dictionaries
- We can loop over a dictionary using the `items()` method.
```{python}
user_0 = {
'login': 'fcampelo',
'first': 'felipe',
'last': 'campelo'
}
# notice that we can have multiple iterating variables, 
# and that dictionaries are *unordered*
for key, value in user_0.items(): 
    print("\nKey: " + key + "\tValue: " + value)
```

## Working with dictionaries
- Sometimes we will only need to loop through keys and not values (or vice versa)
```{python}
user_0 = {'login': 'fcampelo', 'first': 'felipe', 'last': 'campelo'}
for key in user_0.keys():
    print(key.title())
```
```{python}
for value in user_0.values():
    print(value.upper())
```

## Working with dictionaries
- You can update dictionaries using the `.update()` method:
```{python}
w = {"house":"Haus","cat":"Katze","red":"rot"}
w1 = {"red":"rouge","blau":"bleu"}
w.update(w1)
print(w)
```

## Lists of dictionaries
```{python}
alien_0 = {'color': 'green', 'points': 5}
alien_1 = {'color': 'yellow', 'points': 10}
alien_2 = {'color': 'red', 'points': 15}
aliens = [alien_0, alien_1, alien_2]

for alien in aliens:
    print(alien)
```

## Nested dictionaries
```{python}
users = {
    'aeinstein': {'first': 'albert','last': 'einstein','location': 'princeton'},
    'mcurie': {'first': 'marie','last': 'curie','location': 'paris',}}

for username, user_info in users.items():
    print("\nUsername: " + username)
    full_name = user_info['first'] + " " + user_info['last']
    location = user_info['location']
    print("\tFull name: " + full_name.title() + "\tLocation: " + location.title())
```

## Summary
- Lists and dictionaries are two very useful and very flexible data types provided by Python.
- You can nest these structures - lists of lists, lists of dictionaries, dictionaries of dictionaries, etc.
- Lists are ordered objects and can be accessed by index, while dictionaries are unordered `key:value` pairs that are accessed using the keys.
