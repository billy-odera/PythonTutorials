## Advanced indexing in Pandas Objects
- So far we've seen one-dimensional and two-dimensional data, in the form of Pandas `Series` and `DataFrame` objects, but often it is useful to store higher-dimensional data, i.e., data that is indexed by more than two keys. 
- A common way of achieving this in Pandas is _hierarchical indexing_, sometimes also called _multi-indexing_. This allows us to incorporate multiple index levels within a single index and, consequently, compactly represent higher-dimensional data within the familiar `Series` and `DataFrame` objects.

## Multiply Indexed `Series`
- Suppose that we want to work with some US State population data, incorporating the year in which the census was taken as part of our analysis:
```{python}
index = [('California', 2000), ('California', 2010),
         ('New York', 2000), ('New York', 2010),
         ('Texas', 2000), ('Texas', 2010)]
populations = [33871648, 37253956,
               18976457, 19378102,
               20851820, 25145561]
```

## Multiply Indexed `Series`
- One (na√Øve) way of doing it would be to simply use the \<state, year\> tuples as keys in a `Series` object, e.g.,
```{python}
import pandas as pd
mydata = pd.Series(populations, index=index)
mydata
```

## Multiply Indexed `Series`
- This, however, could be very unwieldy: for instance, to extract all values from `2000`, we would need a `for` loop (which makes the code look messier than it needs, and also is potentially slow):
```{python}
mydata.index
```
```{python}
# Each index element is a (state, year) tuple. We want to use the second 
# element of these tuples for the indexing. Then, with some Python magic:
mydata[[i for i in mydata.index if i[1] == 2010]]
```

## Pandas' `MultiIndex`
- Pandas provides a data type `MultiIndex`, which allows easier multi-dimensional data indexing.
- A `MultiIndex` is created from the tuples using:
```{python}
index = pd.MultiIndex.from_tuples(index)
index
```
- `MultiIndex` objects contain multiple levels of indexing, as well as multiple labels for each data point which encode these levels.


## Pandas' `MultiIndex`
- Instead of re-creating our data object we can just _reindex_ it using our new `MultiIndex` object:
```{python}
mydata = mydata.reindex(index)
mydata
```
- Notice that we can already see a _hierarchical_ representation of our data.

## Pandas' `MultiIndex`
- Now that our series is multi-indexed, we can extract the data based on any index using a simple slicing notation:
```{python}
mydata[:, 2000]
```
- This not only looks cleaner, but is also much more computationally efficient (since the operation is pushed into the underlying compiled code layer of Pandas) - it may not make much of a difference for this small example, but can be hugely advantageous if you're working with really big data.

## Pandas' `MultiIndex`
- Notice that we could alternatively have stored the same data using a simple `DataFrame` with index and column labels. This equivalence is not accidental, but rather a design choice of Pandas.
- The `.unstack()` method can be used to convert a multiply indexed `Series` into a conventionally indexed `DataFrame`:
```{python}
mydata.unstack()
```
- You can also do the reverse operation using `.stack()`

## Pandas' `MultiIndex`
- Just as we were able to use a `MultiIndex` to represent 2D data as a 1D `Series`, we can also use it to represent 3D (or higher dimensional) data in a `Series` or `DataFrame`.
- Each extra level in a multi-index represents an extra dimension of data, which provides more flexibility in the types of data we can represent.

## Creating `MultiIndex` objects
- The most straightforward way to construct a multiply indexed `Series` or `DataFrame` is to simply pass a list of two or more index arrays to the constructor, in which case the `MultiIndex` is constructed behind the scenes:
```{python}
import numpy as np
df = pd.DataFrame(np.random.rand(4, 2), # 4x2 array of random values
                  index   = [['a', 'a', 'b', 'b'], [1, 2, 1, 2]], # Indices
                  columns = ['data1', 'data2']) # Column names
df
```

## Creating `MultiIndex` objects
- For more flexibility in how the index is constructed, it is possibly to use theconstructors available for `pd.MultiIndex`:
  - `pd.MultiIndex.from_arrays()`
  - `pd.MultiIndex.from_tuples()`
  - `pd.MultiIndex.from_product()`

## `MultiIndex` level names
- Sometimes it is convenient to (re-) name the levels of the MultiIndex. This is done by passing the `names` argument to the constructor method, or by setting the names attribute of an existing index:
```{python}
mydata.index.names
mydata.index.names = ['state', 'year']
mydata
```

## `MultiIndex` for columns
- In a `DataFrame` object rows and columns are completely symmetric, which means that we can also multiply-index the columns.
- First, let's create row and column (hierarchical) indices
```{python}
# the .from_product() constructor generates levels for all combinations
# of its arguments
index = pd.MultiIndex.from_product([[2013, 2014], [1, 2]],
                                   names = ['year', 'visit'])
columns = pd.MultiIndex.from_product([['Bob', 'Guido', 'Sue'], ['HR', 'Temp']],
                                     names = ['subject', 'type'])
index
````

## `MultiIndex` for columns
- Let's now create the `DataFrame` using some (hypothetical) data:
```{python}
data = np.round(np.random.randn(4, 6), 1)
data[:, ::2] *= 10
data += 37

# create the DataFrame
health_data = pd.DataFrame(data, index = index, columns = columns)
health_data
```

## Indexing and slicing 
- Indexing and slicing are relatively straightforward if you think of indices as added dimensions. 
- Consider first the population data we generated earlier:
```{python}
mydata
```

## Indexing and slicing 
- We can easily index with multiple terms:
```{python}
mydata['Texas', 2010]
```
```{python}
# or do partial indexing
mydata['Texas']
```
```{python}
# partial slicing is available if the index is sorted (more later)
mydata.loc['New York':'Texas']
```

## Indexing and slicing 
- With (sorted) indices, partial indexing can be performed on lower levels by passing an empty slice in the first index:
```{python}
mydata[:, 2000]
```
- We can also do boolean masking (e.g., `mydata[population > 19000000]`) and fancy indexing (e.g., `mydata[['California', 'Texas']]`)

## Indexing and slicing 
- For `DataFrames` the same general idea applies. For the health data object, we can select based on different hierarchical levels of columns:
```{python}
health_data['Guido', 'HR']
```

## Indexing and slicing 
- We can use the same indexers as in `Series`:
```{python}
health_data.iloc[:2, :3]
```
```{python}
health_data.loc[:, 'Bob']
```

## Indexing and slicing 
- Each individual index in `loc` or `iloc` can also be passed a tuple of multiple indices:
```{python}
health_data.loc[:, ('Bob', 'HR')]
health_data.loc[(2013, 1), ('Bob', 'HR')]
```


## Rearranging multi-indices
- There are a number of operations that will preserve all the information in the dataset, but rearrange it for the purposes of various computations. 
- An early example was the use of `unstack()` to ocnvert a multi-indexed `Series` to a 2D dataframe, but there are many more ways to finely control the rearrangement of data between hierarchical indices and columns.

## Sorted and unsorted indices
- Many of the `MultiIndex` slicing operations will fail if the index is not _sorted_. 
- Let's create some simple multiply indexed data where the indices are not lexographically sorted:
```{python}
index = pd.MultiIndex.from_product([['a', 'c', 'b'], [1, 2]])
data_unsrtd = pd.Series(np.random.rand(6), index = index)
data_unsrtd.index.names = ['char', 'int']
data_unsrtd
```

## Sorted and unsorted indices
- For various reasons, partial slices and other similar operations require the levels in the `MultiIndex` to be in sorted (i.e., lexographical) order.
- Pandas provides a number of convenience routines to perform this sorting, e.g. `.sort_index()` and `sortlevel()` methods of the `DataFrame`.
```{python}
data_srtd = data_unsrtd.sort_index()
data_srtd
```

## Sorted and unsorted indices
```{python}
data_srtd['a':'b']
```
```{python,error=TRUE}
data_unsrtd['a':'b']
```

## Unstacking indices
- As we saw earlier, it is possible to convert a dataset from a stacked multi-index to a simple two-dimensional representation (optionally specifying the level to use), e.g.:
```{python}
mydata
mydata.unstack(level = 0)
```

## Index setting and resetting
- Another way to rearrange hierarchical data is to turn index labels into columns, which can be done using the `.reset_index()` method. 
```{python}
pop_flat = mydata.reset_index(name = 'population')
pop_flat
```
- Notice that this can be used to make the data structure _tidy data_-compliant, which is very useful if you're combining Python and R's _tidyverse_ for data analysis.

## Index setting and resetting
- On the opposite direction, a _tidy_ dataframe (possibly being imported into Python after preprocessing done using R) can be used to build a `MultiIndex`'ed Pandas object. 
- This can be done using `.set_index()`, which returns a multiply indexed `DataFrame`:
```{python}
pop_flat.set_index(['state', 'year'])
```

## Data Aggregations on Multi-Indices
- For hierarchically indexed data, Pandas' built-in data aggregation methods (e.g., `.mean()`) can be passed a level parameter that controls which subset of the data the aggregate is computed on, which makes calculating group summaries quite convenient!
```{python}
health_data.mean(level = 'year')
```

## Data Aggregations on Multi-Indices
- Group summaries can also be calculated for levels on the columns as well, e.g.:
```{python}
# Calculate the standard deviation of each measurement at each visit
health_data.std(axis = 1, level = 'type')
```

## Summary
- Multiple indexing is a powerful feature of Pandas objects that allow a multidimensional representation of data using the familiar `Series` and `DataFrame` objects
- It can be used to easily access, modify and summarise data at different levels, using efficient compiled code implementations
- Data aggregations can be very simple, as is the conversion to/from tidy data formats, which facilitates integration between R and Pandas for data analysis.
