    "## Python versions\n",
    "\n",
    "There are currently two different supported versions of Python, 2.7 and 3.7. Historically, 2.7 has been the version of choice for Data Scientists. This was due to more stable versions of packages such as Numpy, Pandas and Sci-kit-learn. However, as time has gone on Python 3 has been adopted as the version to use for all things data science. Python 2 is now considered a legacy version of the programming language and is due to be retired (read: not actively maintained) on January 1, 2020.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Somewhat atypical of updates to programming languages, Python 3 introduced many backwards-incompatible changes to the language, so code written for 2.7 may not work under the latest versions of Python and vice versa. For this class all code will use Python 3s.7.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can check your Python version at the command line by running python --version."
