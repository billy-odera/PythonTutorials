    "### R\n",
    "Academics and statisticians have developed R over two decades. R has now one of the richest ecosystems to perform data analysis. There are around 12000 packages available in CRAN (open-source repository). It is possible to find a library for whatever the analysis you want to perform. The rich variety of library makes R the first choice for statistical analysis, especially for specialized analytical work.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cutting-edge difference between R and the other statistical products is the output. R has fantastic tools to communicate the results. Rstudio comes with the library knitr. Xie Yihui wrote this package. He made reporting trivial and elegant. Communicating the findings with a presentation or a document is easy.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advantages\n",
    "* Graphs are made to talk. R makes it beautiful\n",
    "* Large catalog for data analysis\n",
    "* GitHub interface\n",
    "* RMarkdown\n",
    "* Shiny\n",
    "* A language designed for statistical analysis and data science\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Disadvantages\n",
    "\n",
    "* Slow \n",
    "* High Learning curve \n",
    "* Dependencies between libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python\n",
    "Python can pretty much do the same tasks as R: data wrangling, engineering, feature selection web scrapping, app and so on. Python is a tool to deploy and implement machine learning at a large-scale. Python codes are easier to maintain and more robust than R. Years ago; Python didn't have many data analysis and machine learning libraries. Recently, Python is catching up and provides cutting-edge API for machine learning or Artificial Intelligence. Most of the data science job can be done with five Python libraries: Numpy, Pandas, Scipy, Scikit-learn and Seaborn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python, on the other hand, makes replicability and accessibility easier than R. In fact, if you need to use the results of your analysis in an application or website, Python is the best choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advantages\n",
    "* Jupyter notebook: Notebooks help to share data with colleagues\n",

    "* Code Readability\n",
    "* Speed\n",

    "## Python versions\n",
    "\n",
    "There are currently two different supported versions of Python, 2.7 and 3.7. Historically, 2.7 has been the version of choice for Data Scientists. This was due to more stable versions of packages such as Numpy, Pandas and Sci-kit-learn. However, as time has gone on Python 3 has been adopted as the version to use for all things data science. Python 2 is now considered a legacy version of the programming language and is due to be retired (read: not actively maintained) on January 1, 2020.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Somewhat atypical of updates to programming languages, Python 3 introduced many backwards-incompatible changes to the language, so code written for 2.7 may not work under the latest versions of Python and vice versa. For this class all code will use Python 3s.7.\n",
